Today I have done config setups and make some updates in GitHub profile.
Tried generate ssh key settings for login next time without username and password
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "padrinathmgmail.com"

ssh-keygen = to generate ssh keys
-t         = type of key
ed25519    = modern,secure,faster algorithm for ssh keys
-c         = adds comment to key (usually email)

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
unable to start ssh-agent service, error :1058

when trying this I get permission error, to resolve that 
win+r 
type services.msc
search OpenSSH Authentication Agent
Right-click on OpenSSH Authentication Agent → Click Properties.
Set Startup type to Automatic.
Click Start to run the service immediately.
Click Apply → OK

generated ssh keys and added into GitHub ssh page
and tested the connecting by running

ssh -T git@github.com
