AWS Hands-On: EC2 Setup & Hosting a Web Template

Today, I worked on setting up an AWS EC2 instance to host the HTML template ["Stellaris Research"](https://www.tooplate.com/view/2140-stellaris-research) from Tooplate.

Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:

* âœ… Created and configured Key Pairs
* âœ… Set up Security Groups with proper inbound & outbound rules
* âœ… Chose Ubuntu as the AMI for deployment
* âœ… Resolved minor SSH connectivity errors during setup
* âœ… Successfully hosted the template on the EC2 instance

This exercise gave me deeper hands-on experience with AWS infrastructure and strengthened my understanding of cloud deployment workflows**.

ðŸ“¸ Iâ€™ve attached snapshots covering the entire process â€” from initial setup to troubleshooting and final hosting output.

ðŸ’¡ This is just Part 1 â€” Iâ€™ll be posting the continuation and further enhancements in the coming days.
