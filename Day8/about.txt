Daily Learning & Hands-On Journey (AWS + Git + Linux)

As part of my continuous learning, today I explored and practiced:

âœ… Setting up an AWS EC2 instance with IAM user access.
âœ… Hosting my own frontend code from GitHub (deployment setup worked successfully, though I faced some code-level errors while hosting).
âœ… Hands-on practice with Git rollback commands to manage version control effectively.
âœ… Practiced Linux redirection commands to better understand input/output and error handling.

Though the hosting didnâ€™t succeed fully due to code issues, the setup part went smoothly. Every step taught me valuable troubleshooting skills, which is equally important in real-world scenarios. ðŸ’¡

I believe sharing consistent practice and learnings is a great way to grow and connect with like-minded professionals.
