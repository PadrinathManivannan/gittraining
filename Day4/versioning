learnt some basics about git versioning
not so depth but good 
git log
git show commit id
git commt id
git --online
1. What It Is
Git versioning = tracking changes to files over time.

Lets you go back to any previous state of your project.

2. How It Works
Working Directory → your files.

Staging Area → changes ready to save.

Repository → saved history (commits).

3. Key Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
git init              # start tracking
git add file.txt      # stage changes
git commit -m "msg"   # save a version
git log               # view history
git checkout <id>     # go to a version
git diff              # see changes
4. Commit IDs
Each commit gets a unique SHA hash (like a1b2c3...).

This is how Git knows exactly which version is which.

5. Branching
Lets you work on different features without affecting main code.

Merge when ready.

Think of Git as a time machine for code — snapshots (commits) you can travel betweem
